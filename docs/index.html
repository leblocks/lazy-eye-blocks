        <h1>The lazy eye exercise tool</h1>

This game is intended to help people with "Lazy eye" condition train their weaker eye. <a href='http://www.lazyeye.org'
    target='_blank'>Amblyopia</a>, commonly known as lazy eye, is the eye condition noted by reduced vision not
correctable by glasses or contact lenses and is not due to any eye disease. The brain, for some reason, does not fully
acknowledge the images seen by the amblyopic eye. This almost always affects only one eye but may manifest with
reduction of vision in both eyes. It is estimated that three percent of children under six have some form of amblyopia.

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
Recent <a href='https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/259547.php' target='_blank'>studies</a> have shown that
playing blocks games in a dichoptic way (when the eyes see different images) requires information to be sent to both
eyes, making them work cooperatively. By making both eyes cooperate, the amblyopic brain is able to relearn as a result
of an increase in the level of plasticity in the brain.

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
