<h4>Left/Right eye colors configuration</h4>
To configure properly left/right eye colors for a more productive session, do the following:
<ul>
    <li>Put on your anaglyph glasses</li>
    <li>Open <a href="exercise.html" target="_blank">blocks game</a></li>
    <li>Click on the <i>Settings</i> button</li>
    <li>Click on the <i>Left/Right eye color</i> button</li>
    <li>You will see a colored rectangle and a pallette with colors gradually changing from red to blue. This palette is
        clickable, upon click on the palette the color of the colored rectangle above will change.
    </li>
    <li>Now, close your healthy eye and try to adjust the color of the colored rectangle that is above the palette, so
        it would completely match the color of a background. In other words, the colored rectangle must be visible for
        your healthy eye and almost (better completely) invisible for your lazy eye
    </li>
    <li>
        Adjust the color for the other eye in the same manner, so it would be visible for your lazy eye and almost
        (better completely) invisible for your healthy eye
    </li>
</ul>
