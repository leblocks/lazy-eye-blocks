<h1>About</h1>
I have a lazy eye myself. I was born with a huge difference in sight between the two eyes. It was only diagnosed, when I was
seven. Now I'm an adult, and, as a result of a brain suppression, my right eye is working on just 60% of its ability.
One day, I stumbled upon an <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/259547.php">article</a> on the lazy eye
treatment, recommending a game that helps. After a proper search, I
found a few apps for mobile devices, but nothing to use online and free of charge. And so I decided to do it myself.
