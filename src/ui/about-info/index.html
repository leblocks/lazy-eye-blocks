<h1>Lazy eye blocks</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
This game is intended to help people with "Lazy eye" condition train their weaker eye. <a href='http://www.lazyeye.org' target='_blank'>Amblyopia</a>, commonly known as lazy eye, is the eye condition noted by reduced vision not correctable by glasses or contact lenses and is not due to any eye disease. The brain, for some reason, does not fully acknowledge the images seen by the amblyopic eye. This almost always affects only one eye but may manifest with reduction of vision in both eyes. It is estimated that three percent of children under six have some form of amblyopia.
<h2>How does this work?</h2>
Recent <a href='https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/259547.php' target='_blank'>studies</a> have shown that playing blocks games in a dihoptic way (when eyes are seeing different images) requires information to be sent to both eyes, making them work cooperatively. By making both eyes cooperate, the amblyopic brain is able to relearn as a result of an increase in the level of plasticity in the brain.
